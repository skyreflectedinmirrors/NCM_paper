\begin{abstract} % not to exceed 200 words
Abstract should be between 150--200 words and should state briefly the purpose
of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is
often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone.
For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the
author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be
avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the
abstract itself.
\end{abstract}

% established in the field may be used. These keywords will be used for
